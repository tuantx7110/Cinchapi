# ExcersiceC
We implemment a Directed Acyclic Graph. You can test with:

>java -jar ExcerciseC.jar com.cinchapi.DirectedAcyclicGraph

The program will check cases when we insert directed egdes in the graph like https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/courses/cs60/s98/examples/acyclic/image%20500.gif. Apter that it will check whether or not  edge {5-1} is added. If added, it will be failed implementation because adding edge {5-1} will create cycle in graph
